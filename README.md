Very simple "evolution" in Python
# Overview
Basically it simulates a very simplistic form of population growth and then shows you a graph of the population history.
# Installation
Install matplotlib and numpy:
```sh
pip install matplotlib numpy
```
Then you can run it:
```sh
python Pytholution.py [length of simulation (in steps)] [birth chance] [death chance] [replication chance]
```
